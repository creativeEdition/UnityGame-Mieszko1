# UnityGame-Mieszko1
This is my first game created in Unity for mobile devices powered by Android. Game is in Polish language.
I am really happy that I was able working on my own on this project. I learned a lot, but I know that a lot of things I coudl do better. I hope in future I coudl program better. This game is about first historical ruler of Polish country Mieszko I. This game is dedicated for kids. They can learn about Mieszko and his achivements in fun way. Learning by entertaiment is really great way to invite kids to the world of science! :)
